Things yet to do
Doing now

High Priority
-move over to rpi
-connect with email service or twilio
-add case if you currently don't own an investment, it should still work

Medium Priority
-add tests for bot.rb
-refactor everything
-add in tests for failing conditions
-add more tests for user_data.rb
-figure out way to figure out quickly what needs to change for ui changes at vanguard
-add test for whether everything equals user data per portfolio is 100%

Low Priority

Done
-add option so browser stays open until you want to close it
-add case if you don't want an investment, it should sell it
-Display percentage for MMA
-add in percentages so I know how it's working
-fix failing tests
-add exceptions for fetch_vanguard_data.rb
-right now, it checks whether any account (excluding money markets) has
a greater difference than @diff_for_action. This is not the desired
behavior. I want it to check whether the money markets are greater than
@diff_for_action and then sell.
