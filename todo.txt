Things yet to do
Doing now

High Priority
-move over to rpi
-connect with email service or twilio

Medium Priority
-add tests for bot.rb
-refactor everything
-add in tests for failing conditions
-add more tests for user_data.rb
-figure out way to figure out quickly what needs to change for ui changes at vanguard

Low Priority

Done
-Display percentage for MMA
-add in percentages so I know how it's working
-fix failing tests
-add exceptions for fetch_vanguard_data.rb
-right now, it checks whether any account (excluding money markets) has
a greater difference than @diff_for_action. This is not the desired
behavior. I want it to check whether the money markets are greater than
@diff_for_action and then sell.
